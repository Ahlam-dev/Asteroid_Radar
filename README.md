# Asteroid Radar

Asteroid Radar is a Udacity Android development nanodegree course project to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, 
you can view all the detected asteroids given a period of time with data such as the size, velocity,
distance to earth and if they are potentially hazardous. In this project, you will apply the skills such as fetching data from the internet,
saving data to a database, and display the data in a clear, compelling UI.
